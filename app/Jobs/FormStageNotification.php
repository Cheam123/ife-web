/**
 * Push notifications for form process transitions.
 *
 * Modes:
 *  - stage:   a blocking stage became current -> notify its pending
 *             approvers/assignees ("your turn")
 *  - cc:      notify CC recipients they were copied on a submission
 *  - outcome: notify the submitter of the final result (approved/rejected)
 *
 * MOBILE CONTRACT — the app routes on the `data` block, so it is fixed:
 *
 *   data.type = "formtask"   a stage is waiting for the recipient to act
 *               "formentry"  no action needed (an outcome, or a CC copy)
 *   data.id   = the ENTRY id, as a string (FCM data values must be strings).
 *               Not the record id, and not the stage id.
 *
 * Both types open the same screen; they are separate names so analytics and
 * future routing can tell "your turn" apart from "for your information".
 *
 * Two things must never appear on a forms push (the server no longer sends
 * GPS pings, but installed app builds still special-case both):
 *  - `notification_id` — both RN message handlers read that key as a GPS /
 *    app-time ping and POST to sendAppTime.
 *  - type "gps" — special-cased in the app to suppress display.
 *
 * The `notification` block is what makes the OS draw the notification and
 * deliver the tap to the already-wired firebase handlers; FirebaseService
 * always sends it, so these stay ordinary notification+data messages rather
 * than data-only pushes (which take a different path in the app).
 *
 * Defensive by design: users without an fcm_token are skipped and every
 * send failure is logged, never thrown — a notification must not break
 * the approval flow.
